### About ###

Battlespace is a top down space shooter game. It is a multiplayer or single player game. In single player mode, the player fights against bots of varying levels of difficulty. In multiplayer mode, the player fights against an opponent in real time. The player’s motivation to win is to gain coins which can be used to buy power-ups, spaceships, and guns (bullet type, number of bullets fired at once?). 

### Gameplay ###

The player is sitting in a spaceship but the body of the player can’t be seen. Bullets will be fired from the ship towards the direction that it is facing when a button is held (for example the ‘x’ key). The spaceship can be maneuvered around the map by using the ‘w’, ‘a’, ‘s’, and ‘d’ keys, moving the spaceship up, left, right, and down, respectively. In multiplayer, the players will be matched with opponents around the same level. In multiplayer, players cannot exit the set boundary within the level; bumping into the boundary (a bunch of asteroids?) results in losing health. 

### Character Upgrades ###

Each time the player passes a single player level or defeats an opponent, they gain a certain amount experience points (xp) and galactacoins, the currency within the game. The higher the level of the defeated opponent, the more xp and galactacoins gained. Losing a single player match against a bot has no penalty. However, losing a multiplayer match results in a loss of a fixed amount of money and xp. To get to level two, the player must accumulate, for example 100 xp. 

### Levels and Bots ###

The bot levels are single player and offline. Level one would have one bot. Increasing the level number increases the number of bots, bot difficulty, or both.
